    description: The include query allows the inclusion of resources referenced
      in the relationships in the response message. With this query, it is
      possible to avoid additional requests to the server in order to retrieve
      related resources.

  filter:
    name: filter
    description: "Filters resources based on generic or simple filters. Generic
    filters specify matches to fields of the resource based on some logical
    operand. Simple filters may not be able to be expressed with generic filters
    and use a unique name and no operand. For example, the request
    `/1.0/events?filter[lastUpdate][gt]=2020-12-01` filters resources whose
    field `lastUpdate` is greater than `2020-12-01` while the request
    `/1.0/events?filter[lang]=eng,deu` filters resources containing text in
    English or German.
    <br/><br/>
    The current list of operands, only applicable to specific fields at the
    moment, is the following:
    <br/><br/>
    - `gt` (greater than): matches resources whose field has a value greater
    than the one specified in the query. Example:
    `/1.0/event?filter[lastUpdate][gt]=2020-10-12`. Available for the following
    fields: `lastUpdate`.
    <br/><br/>
    - `near` (near location): matches resources whose field is related to a
    geolocation set within a certain radius of the specified position. The
    position/radius is specified as a comma-separated triple of longitude,
    latitude, and distance (in meters). Example:
    `/1.0/event?filter[venues][near]=46.491592,11.337202,10000`. Available for
    the following fields: `venues`.
    <br/><br/>
    The current list of simple filters is the following:
    <br/><br/>
    - `lang` (language filter): Filters resources that contain text in any of
    the languages specified. Languages are specified as comma-separated
    three-letter language codes conforming to [ISO 639-3](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/).
    For example, the filter for resources with text in English or German is
    `/1.0/events?filter[lang]=eng,deu`
